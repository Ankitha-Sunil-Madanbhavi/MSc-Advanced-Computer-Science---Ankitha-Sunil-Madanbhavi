Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an ongoing inflammatory disease, which affects the large intestine primarily the colon and the rectum which results in sores[1]. It brings about the development of inflammation and ulcers in the intestinal mucosal layer, which in many cases produces those effects as the intestinal discomfort, diarrhea, bleeding through the rectum[2]. In order to measure the extent of seriousness of UC, the clinician normally predict based on the Mayo Endoscopic Scoring System (MES) which is a frequently applied classification system having a range of 0 (normal) to 3 (severe). As the MES grading is conducted on the basis of the visual characteristics of the lining of mucous layer, the process may be subjective, constrained and different among different people[3]. In this project we intend to advance the deep learning-based system addressing two major challenges the first one is automatically predicting the MES score from endoscopic images and the second challenge is generating descriptive captions that explain visible mucosal patterns associated with each score. We experiment with different visual encoders to extract the image characteristics that are further injected into a language model to generate the suitable captions. Our results show that the most effective model is able to generate captions that closely resemble reference captions.


This project seeks to create and build a system to diagnose accurately the severity of Ulcerative Colitis based on an automated deep-learning system through endoscopic images. Not only will the system classify the severity level according to the existing clinical scoring system but it will also create accurate and contextually applicable textual description of the main visual characteristics observed. With the aim of assisting clinicians in making decisions more quickly, more consistently, and more informed about treatment, the project will enable a combination of objective severity classification coupled with detailed descriptive feedback, which will eventually lead to better patient care and clinical outcome.
